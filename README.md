# Banner Crawler

This was created to be used as a component of a group final project for the CS4802 course at WPI in C term of 2020-21.

Designed to be used with WPI's version of Banner (which is going away very soon!). Takes in a user id and password, signs into Bannerweb, and then parses through your transcript to determine what courses you've taken. Probably highly insecure.
